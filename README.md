# Incompressible Fluid Simulation

## About

This Project was made in C++ through Visual Studios with the help of OpenGL and GLFW. The goal of the project is to implement an incompressible fluid simulator and put a unique spin on it.

This is a learning project and thus heavily used other resources as references for the hard math and algorithms involved in Fluid Simulations.


## Controls

Move your mouse around the screen while left clicking to add fluid to the simulation. Press Space to freeze the simulation. You may use your mouse to add particles to the sim during this freeze time. The window is also resizable.
